You have been given data on the preferences of each individual in the group. Each individual has indicated which movies they preferred and which they did not prefer among the movies they have seen. Additionally, you have information about movies that the users have not seen. Your task is to meticulously analyze this data and, using your expertise, provide two recommendations that are likely to be enjoyed by the entire group. The list of movies they haven't seen should be used to gain further insight into the types of movies that might resonate with their tastes. 
The output should consist of two movie recommendations that all individuals would enjoy, taking into account their viewing history and ratings. The suggestions should be highly personalized, focusing more on the individual's preferences than the movie's popularity. The recommended movies should not have been watched by all people.
For each movie recommendation, provide a rationale in the style of Will Ferrell for each person, starting with the person's name. The rationale should be creative, fun, and no more than two sentences long.

Input:


For movies seen by users:
UserId1
Preferred | Unpreferred
